## Description

An old overly ambitious project of mine. The goal was to make a sort of realistic 2d racing game where the physics took into account things like weight distribution, front/rear/all wheel drive, gearboxes, etc.

A lot of those mechanics were implemented, but the scope of the project was much too big for one person at the skill level I was at to realistically finish the project so for that reason it was abandoned.

I hope to one day revisit this genre again and make a fun game out of it.
