## Description

An old game which we republished onto Itch. This is the first game [Arnold](https://github.com/arngo) and myself have worked on together. Its a pretty simple endless scrolling shooter with 2 different enemy types. We could of developed more but we decided to instead try and move on to a different game. It was supposed to be a short 1-2 week project that ended up taking over 3 weeks to finish. This was mostly a project about learning the ins and and outs of the Godot Engine and also to try an manage a short deadline(winter break).
