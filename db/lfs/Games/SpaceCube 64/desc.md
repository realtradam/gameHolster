## Description

An entry into the Toronto Gamejam 2024, this game was developed for real Nintendo 64 hardware and for the game showcase we demoed the game running on a real Nintendo 64.

Later we ported this game to the web which is what you can see above and play. It runs significantly better on the web, on the Nintendo the framerate would drop as low at 10fps.
