## Description

Help "Orc", the brave orc, navigate the precarious Arena of Time and prove to all what a mighty adventurer they are!

In my opinion the best game I have made so far and the one I am the most proud of. It has the most unique gameplay out of all the games I have worked on and a great considerable amount of effort went into this.

It also won first place overall in the [Raylib 5K gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/raylib-5k-gamejam) which is awesome!
